# Welcome to my blog!

I am a researcher in the field of uncertainty analysis and design optimization. I primarily work with scarce data arising in structural optimization applications wherein I use probabilistic and statistical learning methods. I intend to use this blog to discuss interesting things that are fully/semi-related to my research.
